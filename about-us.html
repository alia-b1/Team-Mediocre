	Navigating a male-dominated industry as women in tech can be difficult.</b><br><br>
	Often we can find ourselves in situations where we are made to feel less heard, excluded and sometimes taken advantage of because of our gender. It is important that women in tech, and our male allies, share our collective stories, knowledge and experiences to find strategies and solutions to work towards equality and inclusion in the workplace.

<h4 class=box-title>Jillian Kowalchuk</h4>
<p class=box-content>I have experience working directly with vulnerable groups in various capacities including campaign design, implementation, coordination, and research. I am able to condense difficult concepts and datasets into easily digestible formats to mobilise innovation and change at a scale needed to respond to public health and safety issues. I hold a Master of Science degree in Public Health from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in addition to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology from the University of Alberta.</p>

<h4 class=box-title>Alia Barakzai</h4>
<p class=box-content>I am an archaeology student living in Arthur Tattersall House. I am very friendly and approachable so I can quickly and efficiently help to find solutions to any issues you have. Having spoken to a few people from both Arthur Tattersall and John Tovell, the main issues I would focus on are: Ensuring the WiFi remains accessible in all areas of the buildings and on all devices Improving the laundry rooms in terms of cleanliness, the opening times (hopefully making them 24 hours), how they are paid for.</p>
