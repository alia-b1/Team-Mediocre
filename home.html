  <h1><em>"It took me quite a long time to develop a voice, and now that I have it, I am not going to be silent." â€”Madeleine Albright</em></h1>
  <h2>Navigating a male-dominated industry as women in tech can be difficult. Often we can find ourselves in situations where we are made to feel less heard, excluded and sometimes taken advantage of because of our gender. It is important that women in tech, and our male allies, share our collective stories, knowledge and experiences to find strategies and solutions to work towards equality and inclusion in the workplace.</h2>
